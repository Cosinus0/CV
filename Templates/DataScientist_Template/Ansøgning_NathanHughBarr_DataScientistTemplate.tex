\opening{Dear Jette Corfitzen:}

I have performed data analysis throughout my tertiary education on many types of data sets, ranging from small to large, complete and incomplete. These data sets have not only encompassed my field of study, physics and mathematics but also biology and chemistry. I can contribute my past experiences working with these different types of data sets to this position. I can perform both mathematical and numerical analysis on data sets and on mathematical models. I am versed in data analysis using python and matlab and i am quick to pickup any programming languages this position requires. I have experience in building mathematical models from the ground up using both text book theory and research from published articles. I have a wealth of experience working in project groups which i can contribute to this position through my ease of working in a team environment and my ability to immerse myself quickly in the project.    

I view myself as a cheerful and optimist person who is looking for new challenges.

I have attached a copy of my CV and a transcript of my bachelor and master's degree. I look forward to hearing from you about this position.   

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}

%I feel that I am fit for the position due to the following points. Physics as a discipline is based on a strong theoretical fundament and the ability to solve problems and I have this competence. I have an analytical competence through studying mathematics.
