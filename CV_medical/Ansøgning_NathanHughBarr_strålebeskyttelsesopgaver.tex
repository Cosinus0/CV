\opening{Dear Haraldur Hanneson:}

I writing to apply for the Naturvidenskabelig medarbejder til spændende stråle-beskyttelsesopgaver position. I completed my Master's degree on the 7th of May and this position has taken my interest. I am fresh out of university where most of my focus has been spend on research and didactics. The research I have participated in have been using techniques revolving around radiation. I have partaken in different forms of x-ray scattering and light scattering of polymer systems and lipid membranes. I have a solid physics fundament which I can bring into this position. 

I have attached a copy of my resume and a transcribe of my bachelor and master's degree. I look forward to hearing from you about this job.   

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
