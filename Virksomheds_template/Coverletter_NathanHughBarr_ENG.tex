\begin{letter}{}
\opening{To whom it may concern:}
I am a newly graduated master of science in Physics and Mathematics looking for work experience in the data analytics job market. I have throughout my education amassed a range of abilities which I believe can be of use to the data analytics team at your company.

\underline{\textbf{Project based work}}

I have experience working on problem orientated projects, all of them being multidisciplinary projects in science. I can both work unsupervised and in a team environment. When on a project I am self driven and I plan and manage the necessary steps to complete the project within the deadline.  

 
\underline{\textbf{Problem Solver}}

I have experience being a problem-solver when working on projects. I have experience trimming down the problem to its essence while still keeping the nature of the problem, the focus. When working on the problems I use numerical and analytical tools to investigate and find solutions.   


\underline{\textbf{Complete data analysis}}

I have knowledge in the programming languages Matlab and Python where I can perform data extraction from databases and data analysis. I can also write scripts that can automate the analysis process and I can implement mathematical models to analyse trends in the data. I am also versed in multiple forms of data visualisation and I can report conclusions based on data sets clearly and convey the conclusions to a wide audience.


\underline{\textbf{Multidisciplinary Education}}

From my multidisciplinary education in physics and mathematics, I have acquired the ability to be analytical and structured in the way I work. I am critical when I work with data analysis and I have good data ethics. I have a strong foundation in mathematics and physics which enables me to tackle abstract problems.
\\

Lastly, I would like to give you an overview of who I am as an employee. I am an ambitious and optimistic person who will gladly help when ever and where ever I can. I learn quickly, I am efficient when on a project and I am not shy when it comes to responsibility and challenges. I would enjoy meeting for coffee where we can talk about current projects in your company and how I can help.   
   



   

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
